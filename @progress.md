## Bug Fixes

### 2024-03-19
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')" error in Header component
  - Issue: The language detection from URL path wasn't properly handling undefined translations
  - Solution: Added additional check to return 'en' as default language when the path segment doesn't match any available translations
  - Files modified: src/components/Header.tsx 

- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'disclaimer')" error in Footer component
  - Issue: Similar to Header component, language detection wasn't handling undefined translations
  - Solution: Added the same check to return 'en' as default language when the path segment doesn't match any available translations
  - Files modified: src/components/Footer.tsx 

- Fixed Vercel build error for /ask-sorting-hat page
  - Issue: Build failing due to environment variable check during build time
  - Solution: Moved environment variable check to runtime and handled missing API key gracefully
  - Files modified: src/app/api/chat/route.ts

### Added Google Analytics Tracking

1. Integrated Google Analytics (GA4) tracking code:
   - Added Google Analytics script to the root layout file (src/app/layout.tsx)
   - Used Next.js Script component with "afterInteractive" strategy for optimal loading
   - Configured with measurement ID: G-M4GXJKKP23
   - Implemented proper script loading and initialization

2. Implementation details:
   - Used Next.js Script component for better performance and control
   - Added the gtag.js script with proper async attribute
   - Configured the dataLayer for tracking
   - Placed in the document head for earliest possible initialization

This integration enables tracking of website visits, user behavior, and other analytics data through Google Analytics 4, providing valuable insights into site usage and performance.

### Improved Google Analytics Implementation

1. Created a dedicated GoogleAnalytics component:
   - Created new file: src/components/GoogleAnalytics.tsx
   - Implemented as a client component with 'use client' directive
   - Added proper TypeScript type declarations for gtag
   - Included debug logging to help troubleshoot tracking issues

2. Enhanced tracking capabilities:
   - Added route change tracking using Next.js navigation hooks
   - Implemented automatic page_path parameter updates
   - Added error handling and load event callbacks
   - Enabled debug mode for easier troubleshooting

3. Updated root layout:
   - Removed inline Google Analytics scripts
   - Added the GoogleAnalytics component to the body
   - Maintained the same tracking ID (G-M4GXJKKP23)

These improvements provide more robust analytics tracking, better debugging capabilities, and proper handling of client-side navigation events in the Next.js application.

### Added Environment Variable Support for Google Analytics

1. Enhanced GoogleAnalytics component:
   - Refactored to use environment variables for the measurement ID
   - Added fallback to default ID if environment variable is not set
   - Updated all references to use the environment variable

2. Added environment configuration:
   - Created .env.local file for local development
   - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID environment variable
   - Set the current measurement ID (G-M4GXJKKP23) as the default value

3. Benefits of this approach:
   - Easier management of different tracking IDs across environments
   - Better security by not hardcoding IDs in the codebase
   - Simplified process for updating the ID in the future
   - Follows Next.js best practices for environment configuration

This implementation makes it easier to manage Google Analytics configuration across different environments (development, staging, production) and improves the overall code maintainability.

### Updated Google Analytics Implementation to Follow Official Guidelines

1. Relocated Google Analytics code to comply with Google's official requirements:
   - Moved the tracking code from body to head section of the document
   - Placed the code immediately after the opening head tag
   - Maintained the use of environment variables for the measurement ID
   - Kept the Next.js Script component with afterInteractive strategy

2. Simplified the implementation:
   - Removed the separate GoogleAnalytics component
   - Integrated the code directly in the root layout
   - Reduced complexity while maintaining the same functionality
   - Ensured proper tracking across all pages

3. Benefits of this approach:
   - Full compliance with Google's official implementation guidelines
   - Improved tracking accuracy and reliability
   - Simplified codebase with fewer components
   - Maintained environment variable support for flexible configuration

This update ensures that the Google Analytics implementation follows Google's official guidelines while maintaining the benefits of the previous improvements, such as environment variable support and optimal loading strategy.

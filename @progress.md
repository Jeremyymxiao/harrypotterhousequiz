## Bug Fixes

### 2024-03-19
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')" error in Header component

  - Files modified: src/components/Header.tsx 

- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'disclaimer')" error in Footer component
  - Issue: Similar to Header component, language detection wasn't handling undefined translations

    description: 'Welcome to the Hogwarts Enrollment Q&A page! Here we answer common questions about admission to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.',
    questions: {
      admissionProcess: {
        question: 'What is Hogwarts\' admission process?',
        answer: 'When a young witch or wizard is born, the Quill of Acceptance writes their name in the Book of Admittance, kept in a secret chamber at Hogwarts. On their 11th birthday, Hogwarts sends an owl with their acceptance letter, officially welcoming them to the school!'
      },
      howToApply: {
        question: 'How do I apply to Hogwarts?',
        answer: 'You don\'t need to actively apply. Hogwarts selects qualified young witches and wizards and sends them acceptance letters. Magical ability is innate, and Hogwarts\' magic can identify all children with magical talents and invite them at the appropriate time.'
      },
      over11: {
        question: 'I\'m over 11 years old and haven\'t received an acceptance letter. Do I still have a chance to attend?',
        answer: 'Unfortunately, according to Hogwarts tradition, students over 11 years old cannot enroll. Hogwarts\' educational system is designed as a seven-year curriculum, starting at age 11, ensuring students can completely learn all necessary magical courses.'
      },
      preregistration: {
        question: 'What does the "pre-registration" mentioned online refer to?',
        answer: 'NetEase developed a game called "Harry Potter: Magic Awakened" that conducted multiple beta tests and events before its official launch, some requiring pre-registration. This is unrelated to the Hogwarts enrollment process described in the novels and films and is simply a marketing activity for the game.'
      },
      tuition: {
        question: 'How much does Hogwarts cost? How do I pay?',
        answer: 'Hogwarts does not charge tuition fees. In the wizarding world, Hogwarts education is provided free to all admitted witches and wizards. Students only need to purchase textbooks, wands, robes, and other personal items. Please note that in reality, anyone asking you to pay Hogwarts tuition is likely attempting to scam you.'
      },
      uniform: {
        question: 'How do I purchase uniforms and a wand?',
        answer: 'After receiving their acceptance letter, young witches and wizards visit Diagon Alley to purchase their robes, wands, and other school supplies. Robes can be bought at Madam Malkin\'s Robes for All Occasions, while wands are selected at Ollivanders. Remember, the wand chooses the wizard, not the other way around!'
      },
      realExistence: {
        question: 'Does Hogwarts really exist?',
        answer: 'That\'s an excellent question. Hogwarts exists in the heart of everyone who believes in it. Technically, Hogwarts is a fictional magical school created by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series. By reading the novels and watching the films, we can learn about the magic of this school and the beauty of campus life. As a fan site, we recommend that anyone would benefit from reading these wonderful magical stories.'
